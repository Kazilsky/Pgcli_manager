## üìÅ Configuration
- Connections are stored in ~/.pgcli_manager/connections.conf
- History is stored in ~/.pgcli_manager/history.log

## ‚öôÔ∏è Security Considerations
By default, passwords are saved in the file. If you'd prefer to enter the password each time you connect, you can leave it out when adding a new connection. The script will prompt for the password securely during runtime.connections.conf

To avoid saving passwords, simply leave the field blank when adding a connection. You'll be prompted for it when connecting to the database.password

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with connecting to the database or any other command, try the following:

- Ensure that is installed and working properly.pgcli
- Double-check your configuration file () for correctness.connections.conf
- If there are permission issues with configuration files, make sure they are readable and writable.
